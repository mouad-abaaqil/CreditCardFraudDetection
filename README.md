# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It includes detailed data analysis and visualizations to accurately identify and prevent fraudulent activities. This project was developed as part of a data science initiative to enhance security in financial transactions.

## Project Structure

- `Detection_de_Fraude_avec_Python.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.
- `LICENSE`: Project license.
- `.gitignore`: Git ignore file to exclude unnecessary files.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CreditCardFraudDetection.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd CreditCardFraudDetection

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. **Download the dataset**:
   Download the credit card fraud detection dataset from Kaggle:
