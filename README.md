## Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant issue that affects financial institutions and customers alike. This project leverages machine learning to build a predictive model that can distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is a collection of credit card transactions, which includes features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized principal components obtained using PCA. The target variable indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
